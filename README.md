## What is Overtrading?

Overtrading is trading too often or too aggressively in the financial
market. It can lead to large profits, but it also comes with significant
psychological risks and can ruin your trading success.

## Causes of Overtrading

The major cause of overtrading is a dream to become rich overnight.
Traders think they will make more money if they trade more. But in fact,
the opposite is true --- the more you trade, the more you are exposed to
risk.

Other causes include:

-   FOMO (fear of missing out)
-   Boredom
-   Revenge trading

## Signs of Overtrading

Here are a few common signs of overtrading:

-   Desperation
-   Feeling regret
-   Neglecting your strategy
-   More positions than usual

## Risks of Overtrading in Quotex

While trading with Quotex, your average payout possibility is 80%. That
means if you risk \$100, you can earn \$80 --- in other words, the risk
is greater than the reward. Therefore, you must maintain a 60% win rate
above the breakeven. Overtrading may disturb your win rate, leading to
low profitability or net losses.

You may at some point face a series of lost trades. In such cases,
traders lose 5 to 10 trades in a row. Two losses eat up around three
profit transactions, so if you trade randomly or go beyond the limits,
you can turn your profit into a loss.

your money management to play the long game.

Here are some tips:

-   Set a daily loss limit
-   Only trade with risk capital
-   Use stop-loss orders
-   Take breaks throughout the day

## Psychological Risks of Overtrading

The psychological risks of overtrading are real and can be very
damaging. Often traders become overly confident and take on more risk
than they can handle.

This can lead to large losses, which can cause traders to become
despondent and depressed. It can lead to negative thought patterns and a
lack of confidence, ultimately leading to further losses.

The best way to avoid the psychological risks of overtrading is to
ensure that you have a well-thought-out trading plan that you follow
diligently.
